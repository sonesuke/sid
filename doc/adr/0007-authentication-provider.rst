ADR 0007: Select Azure Entra ID External Identities for Authentication
================================================================

Status
------
Accepted

Context
-------
The platform requires a secure, scalable, and standards-abiding Identity Provider (IdP) to manage external users (Tenants).
We need to support:
1.  OpenID Connect (OIDC) standards.
2.  Branded login pages.
3.  Reasonable cost scaling.

The candidates considered were:
- **AWS Cognito**: Native integration with AWS.
- **Auth0**: Developer-friendly, feature-rich.
- **Azure Entra ID External Identities**: Microsoft's CIAM solution.

Related Requirements

*   Satisfies :ref:`Supported Authentication Methods <FR-AUTH-001>`
*   Satisfies :ref:`Multi-Factor Authentication <NFR-SEC-003>`
*   Satisfies :ref:`Adaptive Authentication <NFR-SEC-006>`

Decision
--------
We will use **Azure Entra ID External Identities** as the primary Authentication Provider for external users.

Rules:
1.  The `Auth Service` component in the architecture maps to Azure Entra ID.
2.  The API Gateway will validate JWTs issued by Azure Entra ID.

Rationale
---------
1.  **Cost Efficiency**:
    **Auth0** is significantly more expensive at scale for B2C/SaaS use cases compared to platform-native solutions. Azure Entra ID offers a generous free tier (MAU based) and competitive pricing.

2.  **Usability & Developer Experience**:
    **AWS Cognito** is known for its steep learning curve, limited customization options for hosted UI, and AWS-specific idiosyncrasies that can complicate standard OIDC flows.
    **Azure Entra ID** provides a robust, enterprise-grade identity foundation with better documentation and standard compliance than Cognito, making it easier to implement and maintain.
    Although it adds a multi-cloud element (AWS + Azure), the identity layer is logically separate enough that the integration overhead is manageable via standard OIDC.

Consequences
------------
Positive:
- Lower cost than Auth0.
- Better standards compliance and DX than Cognito.
- Leveraging Microsoft's security expertise.

Negative:
- **Multi-Cloud Complexity**: We introduce a dependency on Azure while running infrastructure on AWS. This requires managing credentials and billing across two clouds.
- **Latency**: Potential slight increase in latency for token validation if public keys are fetched across cloud boundaries (negligible in practice with caching).
